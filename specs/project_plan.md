## Phase 0: Preparation
- [x] Review current onboarding code and design system specs
- [x] Set up `specs/memory.md` for task tracking
- [x] Create/verify `styles/theme.css` for tokens and base styles

## Phase 1: Arami Visual & Structural Refactor (Complete)
- [x] Update global styles for Arami gradient background and micro-grain overlay
- [x] Refactor onboarding container to use `.card` with indigo glow, rounded corners, and padding
- [x] Update headings to use gradient text and correct font sizes
- [x] Refactor inputs to use dark backgrounds, rounded corners, and animated placeholders
- [x] Update button to use Arami gradient, rounded corners, and scale animation
- [x] Style progress dots with Arami color tokens and spacing
- [x] Apply 16/24/32px spacing throughout
